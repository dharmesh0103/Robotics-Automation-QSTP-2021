# Robotics-Automation-QSTP-2021
In this project we will first about ROS(Robotics Operating System) - a software framework designed to make robotics development easier. Along with this we will also be working with Gazebo which is a robotics simulator where we can create our own robot models or even test out code on pre-existing Turtlebot.
The final project is programming an autonomous ground robot, this will involve combining the tasks that we will do in this 6 weeks course.
